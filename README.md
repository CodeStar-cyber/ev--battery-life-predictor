# Battery Health Prediction Project

This project focuses on analyzing lithium-ion battery degradation using Resistance (Re), Charge Transfer Resistance (Rct), Capacity, and Test Cycle data.

### ✅ Phase 1 Completed:
- We studied Battery ID 6 in detail
- Observed that both Re and Rct increase as cycles increase
- Capacity decreases over the cycle life
- Rct shows stronger early warning signs of degradation

### 📌 Next Step (Phase 2):
- Check correlations between features
- Select the most important inputs for machine learning prediction
